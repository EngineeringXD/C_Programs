# C_Programs
Contains lots of basic C programs, can be used to learn practice or interview prepration

Series: Learn C by examples <engineeringxd.com>

(A collection of various C programs that are used frequently in academic environment as well as interview). Refer to Index file to find out the problem statement and name of its solution program. Questions are categorized in different groups but they are not arranged in any manner, I keep adding questions continuously hence one may find a question with lower difficulty level after a difficult question.

Note: I strongly believe in academic integrity, hence please do not copy programs to complete your home-work assignments. Rather use these C codes to learn basics of C. Set of questions is prepared to cover from most basic C programs up-to Interview standard programs. This series contains programming examples for solving many engineering problems also. Every Enthusiast is welcome to make this repository more rich.
Thanks, Purnendu Kumar.
